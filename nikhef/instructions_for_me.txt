OK OK This is the happy flow 

1)  mv this entire dir to Nikhef
2)  mv .sh and .sub file out of the dir into the parent dir (set it aside)
3)  compress this dir into `velopix.tar.gz` use following cmd:
        tar czf velopix.tar.gz nikhef/ 

4) verify content of the compressed file:
        tar tzf velopix.tar.gz

5) make .sh executable:
        chmod +x VeloPix_stoomboot_envHandler.sh

5) upload .sub job to cluster:
        condor_submit VeloPix_Full_Job.sub


Maybe good idea to verify this with xenofone :))
